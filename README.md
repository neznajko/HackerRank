# HackerRank

Ok these are problems from HackerRank site, it's a bit more 
challenging than GfG, cos there are no time complexity hints,
but there are other languages like Ruby, Go, etc.

# ruby
- Sherlock.rb [ Hash ] Check if a string is valid according to Sherlock considerations
- encryption.rb { Stuff } Ruby on Strings
- minloss.rb ( Sorting ) That's interesting
- themaxsubrry.rb [ dp ] check this out
- coins_change.rb [ dp ] the classical variation
- Samantha.rb [ dp ] sum of all substrings 4 O( n )

- FibonacciMod.rb [ dp ] tha'ts easy not medium:)
