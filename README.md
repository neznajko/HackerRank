# HackerRank

Ok these are problems from HackerRank site, it's a bit more 
challenging than GfG, cos there are no time complexity hints,
but there are other languages like Ruby, Go, etc.

# ruby
- Sherlock.rb [ Hash ] Check if a string is valid according to Sherlock considerations
- encryption.rb { Stuff } Ruby on Strings
- minloss.rb ( Sorting ) That's interesting
- themaxsubrry.rb [ dp ] check this out

# go
- nondivisable.go [ Hashing ] max subset of non divisible pairs
